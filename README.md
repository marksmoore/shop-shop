## Redux Store

### This challenge is to refactor a completely functional application that uses a React's Context API, and convert it using Redux to manage state

### User Story

    AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
    I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
    SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

### Acceptance Critera

    GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state

    WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
    THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API

    WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
    THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider

    WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
    THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API

    WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
    THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API

    WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
    THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
